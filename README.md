# Overview

I have been interested in game development my whole life and I wanted to learn more about the process of making video games. I decided to spend two weeks diving into a game engine named Unity and I was able to make a little demo of an FPS. The player can control a character and they can shoot and destroy enemies that spawn. The enemies have a very simple AI system where they continously patrol between the map and once they detect the player, they run towards them.

I wrote this software so that I can take more steps into game development and I am looking forward to applying these skills to future projects.

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}

To develop this demo, I used Unity and Visual Studio. C# was the programming language that was used.

# Future Work

For the future, I need to be a little more reliant on tutorials. I would often spend more time that I should've trying to solve a problem when I should've just been patient with the process and watched more tutorials to help me when I was stuck.
